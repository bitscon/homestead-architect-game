# Next Steps

This file outlines the current goal and actionable next steps for development sessions.

## Current Goal
**Status:** Repository setup complete, ready for development work
**Goal:** Determine next development priorities based on user requirements

## Immediate Next Steps

### Discovery Phase (if no specific goal provided)
- [ ] Review GitHub Issues for prioritized bugs or features
- [ ] Check if application builds and runs locally
- [ ] Identify any failing tests or linting issues
- [ ] Review recent commits to understand current development focus

### Potential Development Areas
- [ ] **Bug Fixes** - Address any reported issues or UI problems
- [ ] **Feature Development** - Implement new functionality based on user needs
- [ ] **Code Quality** - Improve existing code, fix TypeScript errors, optimize performance
- [ ] **Documentation** - Update or create documentation as needed
- [ ] **Testing** - Add test coverage for existing features
- [ ] **Deployment** - Resolve any deployment issues or improve CI/CD

## Open Questions
- What specific functionality does the user want to work on?
- Are there any critical bugs that need immediate attention?
- Is this a new feature session or maintenance/debugging session?
- Does the user have specific requirements or constraints?

## Current Blockers
- None identified - repository appears to be in good working order
- Environment setup instructions are clear in README.md
- All necessary files and configurations appear to be in place

## Development Environment Readiness
- [ ] Docker Compose available for development environment
- [ ] Node.js 20+ and npm 10+ available for local development
- [ ] Supabase credentials configured in `.env.dev` (if needed)
- [ ] Repository cloned and dependencies installed

## Notes for Next Session
- Start by reading AGENT_SOP.md, PROGRESS.md, NEXT.md, and README.md
- Ask user: "What do we want to accomplish today?" with 2-3 specific options
- Focus on small, shippable changes first
- Always run linting and type-checking before session end
- Update PROGRESS.md and NEXT.md before finishing session
